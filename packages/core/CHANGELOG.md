## 5.1.1

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 76c0832: Add compression support for additional content-types: n-triples, n-quads, trig and JSON SPARQL results.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1cafa55: Support for compression by default.

  This change is considered as a breaking change as the `routeHandler` now needs to return the `reply` object in order to be compatible with the support for compression. This is necessary to allow the server to handle the compression of the response.

  Before migrating, make sure to update your custom plugins and upgrade all plugins to the latest version.

### Patch Changes

- 1cafa55: Return `reply` in the `routeHandler`, in order to be compatible with the support for compression.

### Major Changes

- 849fa3d: Health check is now exposed at `/healthz` instead of `/health`
- 4b515f8: Use 'plugins' instead of 'middlewares'
- 849fa3d: Trifid Plugins should return an object:

  ```js
  /** @type {import('trifid-core/types/index.js').TrifidPlugin} */
  const factory = async (trifid) => {
    return {
      defaultConfiguration: async () => {
        return {
          methods: ["GET"],
          paths: ["/hello"],
          // ...
        };
      },
      routeHandler: async () => {
        /**
         * Route handler.
         * @param {import('fastify').FastifyRequest} _request Request.
         * @param {import('fastify').FastifyReply} reply Reply.
         */
        const handler = async (_request, reply) => {
          reply.send("Hello, world!");
        };
        return handler;
      },
    };
  };

  export default factory;
  ```

  The factory should also be a promise.

  Previously, the factory was a function that returned an Express middleware.
  Since the move to Fastify, we are now returning an object with two methods: `defaultConfiguration` and `routeHandler`.
  The `routeHandler` method should return a route handler function.
  The `defaultConfiguration` method should return the default configuration for the plugin.
  This allows the user to use the plugin with the default configuration or to override it.
  This can be useful to simplify the Trifid configuration files.

- d9963cd: Remove the `rewrite` middleware

### Minor Changes

- a454dbb: Expose a `query` function that can be used in all plugins to perform a SPARQL query
- 1dd9ae7: Allow listening on a random port by using port `0`.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 371f4f8: Do not display a body in case of errors.
  This is not possible without breaking components that are using hijackresponse for now.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a94543c: Improve types in general.

  `trifid.start` now returns a `Promise<import('http').Server>` instead of `void`.
  This allows to wait for the server to be ready before doing anything else.

- 552ecf9: The errors middleware is now returning the description of the status code in the body.
