### Major Changes

- 732a9b5: Rename packages to LINDAS namespace and remove Zazuko branding

  Remove all references to Zazuko and rebrand all packages under the LINDAS/Swiss Federal Archives namespace. This allows the fork to be published to npm independently and clearly indicates these are the LINDAS customizations of Trifid, not the original Zazuko packages.

  Package name changes:

  - trifid → lindas-trifid
  - trifid-core → lindas-trifid-core
  - trifid-handler-fetch → lindas-trifid-handler-fetch
  - trifid-plugin-_ → lindas-trifid-plugin-_
  - @zazuko/trifid-_ → lindas-trifid-_

  Author updated to: Swiss Federal Archives / Lindas

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ce4ff33: A new configuration field `mapKind` has been added to the YASGUI plugin.
  This field allows to set the map kind to use in the YASGUI interface, when there are results that have the `http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral` datatype.
  The default value is `default` and the supported values are `default` and `swisstopo`.

  If in the query a row has a column with the `http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral` datatype, the map will be displayed with the `mapKind` specified in the configuration in the Map tab of the YASGUI interface.
  If in that row, there is a column called `wktLabel`, the value of that column will be used as the label of the map, when the geometry is clicked by the user.

### Minor Changes

- c2b4053: It is now possible to configure the default SPARQL query to use in each new YASGUI tab, by configuring the `defaultQuery` configuration field.

  This feature is useful to provide a starting point for users who are not familiar with SPARQL queries and want to explore the data available in the SPARQL endpoint.

  You can define the default query in order to show a specific set of triples, or to show a specific number of triples, or to show a specific set of properties, etc. based on your data model.

  It can be also useful to also include common prefixes in the default query, so users can start writing their queries without having to remember the prefixes.
